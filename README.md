This repository is dedicated to collect links to databases that contain memory error data of the format as described in data_format_memory_errors.xlsx. 
Such data can be used for a CNN-based approach for estimating failure risks of memory modules as described in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2023.104800.
If you use our work, we are happy if you cite it.
